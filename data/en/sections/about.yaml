  Hi, my name is Lukas Feuer. I am a Data Analyst based in Hannover (Germany).
  I studied Psychology (M.Sc.) in Hamburg and Hildesheim with an additional focus
  on statistics and research. I primarily work with
  [R](http://r-project.org) and the tidyverse but I am also very passionate
  about learning new technologies like the
  [Julia](http://julialang.org) programming language.
